# Horse Racing Simulator

## Introduction

The Horse Racing Simulator, created using [Java](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp) and Java Swing is a visual application designed to allow users to simulate races and customise Horses. This application was designed as a university project to enhance my knowledge of graphical user interfaces and object oriented programming.

The program contains several files:

- `MainMenu.java` - Main entry point of the program containing the `tutorial button`, `horse customisation button` and `statistics button`.
- `Horse.java` - Contains the Horse accessor/mutator methods.
- `Race.java` - Contains the race logic such as moving the Horse , announcing winners or checking if a Horse has fallen. 
- `StartRaceGUI.java` - Contains the GUI output for the Horse Race and buttons to navigate back to `Statistics` and `Horse Customisation`.
- `Statistics.java` - Contains a page that displays all current Horses on the page and the results of each previous race. 
- `Tutorial.java` - Contains a tutorial on how to use the program. 
- `CustomiseHorse.java` - Contains options to reset Horse information and add Horses to the program.
- `horseAttribute.txt` - Contains the Horse attributes such as confidence etc.
